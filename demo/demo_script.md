## Demo Script

### Introduction (2 minutes)

**"Today I'll demonstrate our SVD image compression system - a complete framework that makes linear algebra concepts tangible through interactive image compression."**

#### Key Points to Mention:
- SVD provides mathematically optimal compression
- System includes web interface, batch processing, and analysis tools
- Educational value for understanding linear algebra
- Research applications for compression algorithm development

#### Opening Hook:
**"How many of you have wondered what happens mathematically when you compress an image? Today we'll see exactly that, and you'll be able to experiment with it yourself."**

### Part 1: Basic Compression Demo (4 minutes)

#### Step 1: Navigate to Single Compression Page
1. **Action:** Click on "Single Image Compression" in sidebar
2. **Say:** *"Let's start with the core functionality - compressing a single image using SVD."*

#### Step 2: Upload Sample Image
1. **Action:** Drag and drop a portrait image (or use file uploader)
2. **Say:** *"I'm uploading a portrait image - we'll see why this image type works particularly well with SVD compression."*
3. **Point out:** Image preprocessing (resize to 256x256, normalization)

#### Step 3: Demonstrate k-value Slider
1. **Action:** Start with k=10, slowly increase to k=50
2. **Say:** *"Watch how image quality improves as we retain more singular values. The k parameter directly controls the compression level."*
3. **Highlight:** 
   - Real-time compression and display
   - PSNR and SSIM metrics updating
   - Compression ratio changes

#### Step 4: Explain the Mathematics
1. **Action:** Point to the metrics panel
2. **Say:** *"The PSNR measures signal quality - higher is better. SSIM measures structural similarity - closer to 1 is better. Notice how both improve with higher k values."*
3. **Show:** Compression ratio calculation (e.g., "At k=20, we achieve 12.5x compression")

#### Step 5: Quality Comparison
1. **Action:** Toggle between k=10 and k=50
2. **Say:** *"Here's the trade-off: k=10 gives us 25x compression but lower quality, while k=50 gives us 5x compression with much better quality."*

### Part 2: Image Category Comparison (3 minutes)

#### Step 1: Switch to Comparison Page
1. **Action:** Navigate to "Image Comparison" page
2. **Say:** *"Now let's see how different image types respond to SVD compression."*

#### Step 2: Upload Different Image Types
1. **Action:** Upload portrait, landscape, and texture images
2. **Say:** *"I'm uploading three different image categories. Our research shows that image content significantly affects compression performance."*

#### Step 3: Compare Results at Same k-value
1. **Action:** Set k=30 for all images
2. **Say:** *"At the same compression level, notice the quality differences:"*
   - **Portrait:** Point out high PSNR/SSIM values
   - **Landscape:** Moderate quality metrics
   - **Texture:** Lower quality metrics
3. **Explain:** *"This happens because portraits have smooth gradients that create low-rank matrices, while textures have high-frequency details that require more singular values."*

#### Step 4: Show Singular Value Analysis
1. **Action:** Display singular value plots (if available)
2. **Say:** *"The mathematical reason is in the singular value decay - portraits have rapid decay, meaning most energy is in the first few singular values."*

### Part 3: Interactive Analysis (3 minutes)

#### Step 1: Demonstrate Batch Processing
1. **Action:** Navigate to "Batch Processing" page
2. **Say:** *"For research applications, we can process multiple images systematically."*
3. **Show:** Upload multiple images, set k-value range

#### Step 2: Real-time Plotting
1. **Action:** Generate quality vs k plots
2. **Say:** *"These interactive plots show the quality-compression trade-off curves. Each line represents a different image category."*
3. **Point out:** 
   - Different slopes for different image types
   - Diminishing returns beyond k=50
   - Optimal operating points

#### Step 3: Export Functionality
1. **Action:** Download compressed images or analysis report
2. **Say:** *"All results can be exported for further analysis or use in other applications."*

---

### Part 4: Educational Applications (2 minutes)

#### Step 1: Highlight Learning Features
1. **Say:** *"This system is designed for education. Students can:"*
   - See linear algebra concepts in action
   - Understand the relationship between mathematics and image quality
   - Experiment with different parameters safely

#### Step 2: Show Jupyter Notebook Integration
1. **Action:** Briefly show notebook (if time permits)
2. **Say:** *"We also provide Jupyter notebooks for deeper analysis and reproducible research."*

#### Step 3: Mention Open Source Nature
1. **Say:** *"Everything is open source and available on GitHub. Students and researchers can extend the system for their own projects."*

### Conclusion and Q&A (2 minutes)

#### Wrap-up Points:
1. **Technical Achievement:** *"We've built a complete system that makes SVD compression accessible and educational."*
2. **Research Value:** *"Our systematic evaluation across image categories provides new insights into SVD compression characteristics."*
3. **Educational Impact:** *"This bridges the gap between abstract linear algebra and practical applications."*

#### Transition to Questions:
**"I'd be happy to answer any questions about the mathematics, implementation, or potential applications of this system."**

## Common Questions and Answers

### Q: How does SVD compare to JPEG compression?
**A:** *"SVD provides mathematical optimality and no blocking artifacts, but JPEG is more computationally efficient and has better standardization. SVD is excellent for education and research applications."*

### Q: What are the computational requirements?
**A:** *"For 256x256 images, compression takes 15-35ms on standard hardware. The main bottleneck is the SVD computation, which scales as O(mnÂ²)."*

### Q: Can this be used for video compression?
**A:** *"Theoretically yes, by treating each frame as an image, but the computational cost would be prohibitive for real-time applications. It's more suitable for research and educational purposes."*

### Q: Why do portraits compress better than textures?
**A:** *"Portraits have smooth gradients that create low-rank matrix structure. Textures have high-frequency details that require many singular values to represent accurately."*

### Q: Is the source code available?
**A:** *"Yes, everything is open source and available on GitHub with comprehensive documentation and examples."*

## Technical Troubleshooting

### If Web App Won't Start:
1. Check if port 8501 is available
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Try `streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502`

### If Images Won't Upload:
1. Check file format (PNG, JPG, JPEG supported)
2. Verify file size (should be reasonable, <10MB)
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### If Plots Don't Display:
1. Refresh the page
2. Check if matplotlib/plotly are installed
3. Verify data is being generated correctly

### If Performance is Slow:
1. Use smaller images (256x256 recommended)
2. Reduce k-value range for batch processing
3. Close other browser tabs/applications
