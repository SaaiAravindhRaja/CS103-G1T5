## Generated Examples

### Image Categories

1. **Portraits**: Demonstrate excellent compression with smooth gradients
   - High PSNR/SSIM values even at low k-values
   - Compression ratios of 10-50x typical
   - Minimal visual artifacts due to low-frequency content

2. **Landscapes**: Show moderate compression with mixed content
   - Balanced quality vs compression trade-offs
   - Compression ratios of 5-20x typical
   - Natural patterns compress reasonably well

3. **Textures**: Illustrate challenges with high-frequency content
   - Lower compression ratios (2-10x typical)
   - Requires higher k-values for acceptable quality
   - Demonstrates limitations of SVD for complex patterns

### Compression Levels

Each image is compressed at k-values: 5, 10, 20, 50
- **k=5**: Maximum compression, lowest quality
- **k=10**: High compression, fair quality
- **k=20**: Moderate compression, good quality  
- **k=50**: Lower compression, high quality

## Visualizations

### Individual Analysis
- **Singular Values Plots**: Show the decay characteristics for each category
- **Comparison Grids**: Side-by-side visual comparison of compression levels

### Cross-Category Analysis
- **PSNR vs k**: Quality trends across image types
- **SSIM vs k**: Structural similarity trends
- **Compression Analysis**: Quality vs compression trade-offs

## Usage in Documentation

These examples can be used for:
- README illustrations and demonstrations
