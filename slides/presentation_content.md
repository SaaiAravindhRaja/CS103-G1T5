## Slide 3: Theoretical Foundation
**Title:** SVD Decomposition Mathematics

**Content:**
For any matrix A ∈ ℝ^(m×n):
**A = UΣV^T**

Where:
- U: Left singular vectors (m×m orthogonal matrix)

- V^T: Right singular vectors (n×n orthogonal matrix)

**Low-rank approximation:**
**A_k = U_k Σ_k V_k^T**

**Compression ratio:** mn / k(m+n+1)
