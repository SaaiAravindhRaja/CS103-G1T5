## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Write comprehensive docstrings for all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and modular
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Structure

```python
def function_name(param1: type, param2: type) -> return_type:
    """
    Brief description of the function.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of parameter 1
        param2: Description of parameter 2
        
    Returns:
        Description of return value
        
    Raises:
        ExceptionType: Description of when this exception is raised
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Testing Requirements

- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Ensure integration tests pass for workflow changes
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Include performance tests for optimization changes

### Documentation

- Update relevant documentation for any changes
- Include docstrings for new functions and classes
- Add usage examples for new features
- Update README if adding major features
- Ensure all links and references are correct

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/unit/          # Unit tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/   # Integration tests
python -m pytest tests/performance/   # Performance tests

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src tests/
```

### Writing Tests

- Place unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Place integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Place performance tests in `tests/performance/`
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Include both positive and negative test cases

Example test structure:
```python
import pytest
import numpy as np
from src.compression.svd_compressor import SVDCompressor

class TestSVDCompressor:
    def test_compress_channel_svd_basic(self):
        """Test basic SVD compression functionality."""
        compressor = SVDCompressor()
        channel = np.random.rand(64, 64)
        k = 10
        
        U, S, Vt = compressor.compress_channel_svd(channel, k)
        
        assert U.shape == (64, k)
        assert S.shape == (k,)
        assert Vt.shape == (k, 64)
    
    def test_compress_channel_svd_edge_cases(self):
        """Test SVD compression with edge cases."""
        # Test with k larger than matrix rank
        # Test with zero matrix
        # Test with single pixel
        pass
```
